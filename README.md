# Git by Example Minibook

Git is _the_ distributed version control system used in software development today. It's very powerful, but also known for its not-so-obvious syntax.

I got tired of googling the same Git commands over and over again. So I created this step-by-step guide to Git operations, from basic to advanced. You can read it from start to finish to (hopefully) learn more about Git, or jump to a specific use case that interests you.
